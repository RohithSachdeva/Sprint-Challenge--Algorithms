#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Run time complexity is O(n).  Once it reaches the nth iteration.. it will equal n*(n*n) which I believe will shorten down to linear complexity


b) Run time complexity is O(n^2) 


c)




Notes: 
-N Story building ... egg breaks if thrown off floor f or higher .. (so if floor > f .. egg = broken?)  Determine f so that eggs broken is small as possible.  

So basically no idea where f is ... So question is asking what is the best search method for finding f?   Binary search has low runtime complexity but might be a better option?
