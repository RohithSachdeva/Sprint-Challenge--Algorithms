#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Run time complexity is O(n).  Once it reaches the nth iteration.. it will equal n*(n*n) which I believe will shorten down to linear complexity


b) Run time complexity is O(n^2) 


c)

## Exercise II
